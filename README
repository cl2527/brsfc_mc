This version of the pulse sequence splits moves the version specific 
files to subdirectories 14M5, 15M3, etc.

To build a version specific pulse sequence (say 14), do the following 
>  cd 14M5
>  ../prep_psd_files
>  prep_psd_dir
>  ese214M5
>  psdqmake clean sim hw

The Imakefile now defines ESEDIR, ESEMAJOR and ESEMINOR #defines. For 14M5
their values are 14M5 , 14 and 5, respectively

For instance, if you want to run code only on 16, you can type

#if ESEMAJOR == 16
  do_something();
#endif

If you want to run code for 15 or higher, you can type

#if ESEMAJOR >= 15
  do_something_else();
#endif

If you want to modify the common files while testing for a specific scanner, 
you can use these defines to reduce the impact on the other versions until 
the changes have been tested on all platforms.
